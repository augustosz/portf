# How to Create a CLI Tool with Node.js From Scratch (Even If You're New)

So you've got this boring task you do every day. Maybe it's renaming 200 files. Or checking if a website is up. Or converting CSV to JSON. Whatever it is, you keep thinking, "There **must** be a faster way."

Good news? There is. We can build a tiny Node.js CLI tool in about 20 minutes. We'll even push it to NPM so your teammates can install it with one line. Ready? Grab your coffee. Let's code.

## Why Node.js Still Rocks for CLI Tools in 2025

I used to reach for Python or Go when I needed a quick script. Then I realized: **I already know JavaScript**. Why learn another language for a 50-line tool?

Here's why Node.js wins:

- **No context switch.** Same language from browser ‚Üí server ‚Üí CLI.
- **NPM is massive.** Need to parse YAML? There's a package. Want spinners? Got one. Need colors? Two keystrokes.
- **Cross-platform by default.** Windows, macOS, Linux one codebase covers them all.
- **Fast startup.** Node 20 boots in ~40 ms on my M2 Mac. That's quicker than my terminal prompt loads.

And the best part? If you mess up, you fix it in plain JavaScript. No weird compiler errors.

## Quick Checklist Before We Start

Make sure you've got these on your machine:

- **Node.js 18+** (20.x is even better)  
- **npm or pnpm** (I like pnpm's speed, but npm works fine)  
- **A terminal you like** (iTerm, Windows Terminal, the default doesn't matter)

Run `node -v` and `npm -v`. If you see version numbers, you're golden.

## Step 1: Spin Up a New Project in 30 Seconds

```bash
mkdir todo-cli && cd todo-cli
npm init -y
```

That `-y` flag skips the questionnaire. We'll tweak the file later.

## Step 2: Install the Tiny Helpers We Need

```bash
npm install commander chalk@5 ora
```

**What each does:**

- **commander** - parses flags and subcommands so we don't have to.  
- **chalk** - makes text pretty (colors, bold, underline).  
- **ora** - gives us those slick loading spinners you see everywhere.

## Step 3: Create the Entry File

Create `index.js` and paste this starter:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { program } from 'commander';
import chalk from 'chalk';
import ora from 'ora';

program
  .name('todo')
  .description('A tiny CLI to manage your daily tasks')
  .version('1.0.0');

program
  .command('add <task>')
  .description('Add a new task')
  .action((task) => {
    const spinner = ora('Saving task...').start();
    setTimeout(() => {
      spinner.succeed(chalk.green(`Task added: ${task}`));
    }, 500);
  });

program.parse();
```

**Pro tip:** Notice the top line `#!/usr/bin/env node`. That shebang tells Unix systems this file should run with Node. On Windows, NPM handles it for us.

## Step 4: Make It Runnable Locally

Open `package.json` and add:

```json
"type": "module",
"bin": {
  "todo": "./index.js"
}
```

Then link it:

```bash
npm link
```

Now type `todo add "buy milk"` anywhere in your terminal. Boom. Your first command works.

## Step 5: Add More Commands (Because One Is Boring)

Let's list and delete tasks. We'll keep them in a simple JSON file for now.

### 5.1 Create a Tiny Data Layer

Create `lib/store.js`:

```javascript
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs';
import { homedir } from 'os';
import { join } from 'path';

const file = join(homedir(), '.todo.json');

export function readTasks() {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(readFileSync(file, 'utf8'));
  } catch {
    return [];
  }
}

export function writeTasks(tasks) {
  writeFileSync(file, JSON.stringify(tasks, null, 2));
}
```

**Why `homedir()`?** Keeps the file out of your repo and follows OS conventions.

### 5.2 Add List, Delete, and Done Commands

Back in `index.js`, add:

```javascript
import { readTasks, writeTasks } from './lib/store.js';

program
  .command('list')
  .description('Show all tasks')
  .action(() => {
    const tasks = readTasks();
    if (tasks.length === 0) {
      console.log(chalk.yellow('No tasks yet üéâ'));
      return;
    }
    tasks.forEach((t, i) => {
      const icon = t.done ? '‚úÖ' : '‚è≥';
      console.log(`${i}: ${icon} ${t.text}`);
    });
  });

program
  .command('done <index>')
  .description('Mark task as done')
  .action((index) => {
    const tasks = readTasks();
    if (!tasks[index]) {
      console.log(chalk.red('Task not found'));
      return;
    }
    tasks[index].done = true;
    writeTasks(tasks);
    console.log(chalk.green('Marked as done!'));
  });

program
  .command('delete <index>')
  .description('Delete a task by index')
  .action((index) => {
    const tasks = readTasks();
    if (!tasks[index]) {
      console.log(chalk.red('Task not found'));
      return;
    }
    const removed = tasks.splice(index, 1)[0];
    writeTasks(tasks);
    console.log(chalk.red(`Deleted: ${removed.text}`));
  });
```

Try it:

```bash
todo add "write blog post"
todo list
todo done 0
todo delete 0
```

Looks like magic, right?

## Step 6: Handle Edge Cases Like a Pro

Real users do weird stuff. Let's guard against:

- **Empty task names**  
- **Invalid indexes**  
- **Missing JSON file** (we already handled it, but still)

Add this helper in `lib/validate.js`:

```javascript
export function isValidIndex(idx, arr) {
  const n = Number(idx);
  return Number.isInteger(n) && n >= 0 && n < arr.length;
}
```

Use it inside the commands:

```javascript
if (!isValidIndex(index, tasks)) {
  console.log(chalk.red('Invalid index'));
  return;
}
```

Your future self will thank you.

## Step 7: Add Colors, Emojis, and Spinners (Because Fun Matters)

Remember `chalk` and `ora`? Sprinkle them everywhere:

- Success ‚Üí `chalk.green`  
- Errors ‚Üí `chalk.red`  
- Info ‚Üí `chalk.blue`  
- Spinners for any async work longer than 200 ms

Users subconsciously trust tools that feel polished. It's like wearing a clean T-shirt to a meeting small detail, big impact.

## Step 8: Test Your CLI Without Losing Your Mind

You don't need a fancy framework. Add a simple test script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "node test.js"
}
```

Create `test.js`:

```javascript
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

function run(cmd) {
  return execSync(`node index.js ${cmd}`, { encoding: 'utf8' });
}

console.log(run('add "test task"'));
console.log(run('list'));
console.log(run('done 0'));
console.log(run('delete 0'));
```

Run `npm test`. If everything prints correctly, you're solid.

## Step 9: Publish to NPM So Your Friends Can Install It

1. **Create an account** at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com).  
2. **Log in** from your terminal: `npm login`  
3. **Pick a unique name.** If "todo-cli" is taken, try "todo-cli-2025-yourname".  
4. **Bump version if needed:** `npm version patch`  
5. **Ship it:** `npm publish`

Your teammates can now run:

```bash
npm install -g todo-cli-yourname
todo add "ship the thing"
```

Pretty sweet.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Dodge Them

| Pitfall | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| "command not found" after `npm link` | Re-link or restart your terminal. |
| Windows shows weird colors | Tell users to use Windows Terminal or enable ANSI in cmd. |
| JSON file gets corrupted | Wrap writes in `try/catch`, or migrate to a tiny SQLite DB later. |
| Scripts too slow | Use `zx` or compile with `pkg` for a single binary. |

## Ideas to Level Up Your CLI

Once you nail the basics, try these:

- **Interactive prompts** with `enquirer` or `@inquirer/prompts`.  
- **Autocomplete** using `omelette`.  
- **Progress bars** with `cli-progress`.  
- **Config files** in `~/.config/your-tool`.  
- **Themes** so users can pick color schemes.

The rabbit hole is deep, but each step makes your tool feel first-class.

## TL;DR: Your 5-Minute Recap

1. **mkdir** + **npm init**  
2. **npm install commander chalk**  
3. **index.js** with shebang  
4. **npm link** to test locally  
5. **npm publish** to share with the world

You just built a cross-platform CLI tool in plain JavaScript. Next time you catch yourself doing a repetitive task, remember: you can automate it in under an hour. And now you know how.
