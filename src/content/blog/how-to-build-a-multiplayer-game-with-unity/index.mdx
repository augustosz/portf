# How to Build a Multiplayer Game in Unity in 2025: Complete Beginner Tutorial

So you've got this awesome game idea. Your friends love it. You love it. But the moment you imagine people playing together, you freeze. **Multiplayer feels scary, right?** The lag, the bugs, the "why is my friend floating in the air?" moments.

Good news: Unity made this **way easier** in 2025. I built my first 4-player co-op in one weekend using Netcode for GameObjects (NGO). No magic. Just a checklist I'm about to hand you.

Ready? Grab coffee. Let's build.

## Why Unity Wins at Multiplayer in 2025

Let's be real. You could pick Unreal, Godot, or roll your own engine. But Unity still owns the sweet spot:

- **One click, three platforms.** PC, iOS, Switch export and done.
- **Netcode for GameObjects ships with Unity now.** No extra downloads, no weird plugins.
- **Asset Store is stacked.** Need a lobby UI? Five bucks. Need voice chat? Ten.  
- **Community size.** Stuck at 3 a.m.? There's a Discord server awake somewhere.

Oh, and Unity Relay (their free matchmaking service) just dropped **zero-config lobbies**. That alone saved me two days of Googling server stuff.

## What You'll Build Today

Picture this: a tiny 2D arena where up to four players throw paint at each other. Simple. Chaotic. Perfect to learn the ropes.

Here's the plan:

1. Create the project (5 min)  
2. Add Netcode (10 min)  
3. Spawn players and sync color (15 min)  
4. Test on two machines (5 min)  
5. Ship a tiny itch.io build so friends can join (priceless)

Let's cut to the chase.

## Step 1: Create the Project Like a Pro

Open Unity Hub. **Use 2022 LTS or newer** anything older will fight you on Netcode.

1. Click **New Project → 2D (URP)**  
2. Name it "PaintBrawl2025"  
3. **Tick "Enable Git"** so you don't lose work when your cat walks on the keyboard  

Folder trick: Right-click in Assets and make these folders:

- `_Scripts`  
- `_Prefabs`  
- `_Scenes`  
- `_Art`  

Trust me, future you will thank present you.

## Step 2: Install Netcode in 30 Seconds

Window → Package Manager → **Unity Registry**.  
Search "Netcode for GameObjects". Hit **Install**. Done.

*Pro tip: While it downloads, grab a free pixel-art sprite pack from the Asset Store. We'll need something to throw.*

## Step 3: Add the NetworkManager

Create an empty GameObject. Name it **NetworkManager**.  
Add the **NetworkManager** component.  
In the **Transport** slot, pick **UnityTransport**.

Think of the NetworkManager as the **party host**. It decides who can enter, who can talk, and who gets kicked out for eating all the chips.

## Step 4: Make a Player Prefab That Actually Syncs

1. Drag your sprite into the scene.  
2. Add **NetworkObject** component.  
3. Add **NetworkTransform** to sync movement.  
4. Create a new script **PlayerPaint.cs** and paste:

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerPaint : NetworkBehaviour
{
    public GameObject paintBlobPrefab;
    public float throwForce = 5f;

    void Update()
    {
        if (!IsOwner) return; // Only let the owner throw

        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            Vector3 mousePos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition);
            Vector2 direction = (mousePos - transform.position).normalized;
            ThrowServerRpc(direction);
        }
    }

    [ServerRpc]
    void ThrowServerRpc(Vector2 dir)
    {
        GameObject blob = Instantiate(paintBlobPrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
        blob.GetComponent<NetworkObject>().Spawn();
        blob.GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().velocity = dir * throwForce;
    }
}
```

Drag the script onto the sprite.  
Drag the sprite back to **Assets/_Prefabs** to make a prefab.  
Delete the one in the scene we'll spawn it later.

## Step 5: Spawning Players (No One Gets Left Behind)

Create an empty GameObject. Name it **GameManager**.  
Add script **GameManager.cs**:

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

public class GameManager : NetworkBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameObject playerPrefab;

    public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
    {
        if (IsServer)
        {
            SpawnPlayerServerRpc(NetworkManager.Singleton.LocalClientId);
        }
    }

    [ServerRpc(RequireOwnership = false)]
    private void SpawnPlayerServerRpc(ulong clientId)
    {
        GameObject player = Instantiate(playerPrefab);
        player.GetComponent<NetworkObject>().SpawnAsPlayerObject(clientId);
    }
}
```

Assign the player prefab in the inspector.  
Hit **Play**, then click **Host (LAN)**.  
Open a second Unity window with **ParrelSync** (free Asset Store tool) and click **Client**. Boom two players moving and throwing.

*Feels like magic, right?*

## Step 6: Add a Splash of Color (Syncing Variables)

We want each player to have a random color. Easy.

Inside **PlayerPaint.cs**, add:

```csharp
[SerializeField] private SpriteRenderer bodyRenderer;
private NetworkVariable<Color> netColor = new NetworkVariable<Color>();

public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
{
    if (IsServer)
        netColor.Value = Random.ColorHSV(); // Server decides color
    bodyRenderer.color = netColor.Value;
}
```

Now every player sees the same colors. No more "why am I blue on my screen but red on yours?"

## Step 7: Test on Real Devices (Because Wi-Fi Lies)

1. Build & Run → PC, Mac & Linux Standalone.  
2. Check **Server Build**.  
3. Run the build, click **Host**.  
4. In Unity Editor, Play → **Client** and type the local IP (192.168.x.x).  
5. Throw some paint. Notice any lag? If yes, lower the **Send Rate** in **UnityTransport** from 60 to 30.

## Step 8: Ship It on itch.io in 5 Minutes

1. Build again, this time **uncheck** Server Build.  
2. Zip the folder.  
3. Create itch.io account → Upload → Set price to "free or donation".  
4. In the **Networking** section of itch, add a note: "Click **Host** if you're first, else click **Join** and enter host's IP."

Invite your group chat. Watch chaos ensue.

## Common Gotchas (and How to Dodge Them)

- **Physics out of sync?**  
  Make sure **Rigidbody2D** is on the prefab and **NetworkTransform** syncs velocity.

- **Player spawns on top of each other?**  
  Add random spawn points in **GameManager.cs**:

```csharp
Vector3 spawnPos = new Vector3(Random.Range(-5, 5), Random.Range(-3, 3));
player.transform.position = spawnPos;
```

- **Firewalls block connections?**  
  Windows Defender hates indie devs. Add an outbound rule for your game exe.

## Next Steps: From Prototype to Steam

- **Add Unity Relay** so no IP sharing. Free tier handles 100 CCU.  
- **Steamworks SDK** for lobbies, friends list, achievements. Takes about a day.  
- **Voice chat** with Vivox also free under 5k monthly users.  
- **Analytics** with Unity Gaming Services to spot rage-quit moments.

## Quick FAQ

**Do I need a dedicated server?**  
Nope. Start with **Host/Client** model. Scale later if you hit 100+ players.

**Can I do this in 3D?**  
Same steps. Swap sprites for cubes. Unity doesn't care.

**Is Netcode stable?**  
Been production-ready since 2023. Ubisoft uses it for mobile titles. You're safe.
