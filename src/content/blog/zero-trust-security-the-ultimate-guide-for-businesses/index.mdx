# Zero Trust Security in 90 Days: A Step-by-Step 2025 Budget Plan for Small Teams

Hey, can I tell you a quick story? Last Tuesday my neighbor Lisa, who runs a 12-person marketing agency, got a Slack message that looked 100 % legit. Two clicks later, her entire client list was being auctioned on the dark web. **Total panic mode.** 

So we sat at my kitchen table, wiped her tears, and built a Zero Trust shield in 12 days using mostly free tools. That's what I'm sharing today. No fluff. No enterprise buzzwords. Just a plain-English plan you can finish in three months even if your "IT team" is you and a coffee mug.

## What Is Zero Trust in One Sentence?

**Never trust anything, always check everything.**  
Think of it like a bouncer who cards you every time you walk back into the bar even if you were just outside for five seconds.

## Why Zero Trust Now? (The 2025 Reality Check)

- Ransomware now costs **$20 billion** a year (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2025)  
- **88 %** of breaches start with stolen passwords (Verizon DBIR 2025)  
- Average small business uses **1,847 cloud apps** firewalls can't see half of them

So yeah, the old "castle-and-moat" thing is toast. Time for a new game plan.

## The 5 Core Pieces You Actually Need

Let's keep it simple. You only need five Lego bricks. Stack them right and you're golden.

### 1. Identity Lock
- **Multi-factor auth** everywhere (free Google Authenticator works)  
- **Single sign-on** for your top 5 apps (Azure AD, JumpCloud, Okta)  
- **Conditional rules** "no logins from Russia at 2 a.m."

### 2. Device Health
- **Auto-updates** on Windows, Mac, iPhone (Intune, Jamf, or free MDM)  
- **Endpoint protection** even Windows Defender plus cloud analytics is solid  
- **Certificate check** only company laptops get the green light

### 3. Micro-Segmentation
- Split your network like pizza slices  
- Start with one VLAN for finance, another for everyone else  
- Use existing switches or AWS Security Groups no new hardware needed

### 4. Data Guardrails
- **Label sensitive files** (Microsoft Purview free tier)  
- **Block uploads to personal Gmail** with DLP rules  
- **Encrypt the crown jewels** customer lists, code, tax records

### 5. Always-On Monitoring
- **SIEM** Wazuh or Elastic, both open-source  
- **Auto-playbooks** if laptop talks to weird IP, cut it off  
- **Weekly log review** 15 minutes, coffee in hand

## 90-Day Zero Trust Roadmap (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Days 1-7: Discovery Week
1. **Run a free asset scan** Lansweeper or AssetTiger  
2. **List your top 5 sensitive assets** Google Drive folder, SQL server, client database  
3. **Quiz your team** Google form asking "Which apps do you actually use?"

### Days 8-21: Identity Sprint
- Turn on MFA for admins first  
- Move Slack, Google Workspace, and Zoom to single sign-on  
- Create three roles: Admin, Staff, Guest done

### Days 22-35: Device Lockdown
- Force Windows/macOS auto-updates via MDM (free)  
- Install EDR Windows Defender + cloud analytics works  
- Block jailbroken phones (two clicks in Azure)

### Days 36-50: Segment the Network
- Create a "Finance VLAN" only accounting PCs can reach QuickBooks  
- Test it try to ping the ERP from marketing Wi-Fi, should fail  
- Log everything to your free SIEM

### Days 51-70: Data Layer
- Label your top 20 % sensitive files in Microsoft Purview  
- Set DLP rule "no credit-card numbers in emails"  
- Encrypt the shared drive with BitLocker or FileVault

### Days 71-90: Polish & Party
- Run a phishing test KnowBe4 offers 100 free licenses  
- Write a one-page incident playbook if weird login, call me, isolate device  
- Celebrate pizza budget $150, breach cost avoided $4.45 million

## Real Budgets for Real Teams (2025 Prices)

| Item | 1-50 Users | 51-200 Users |
|---|---|---|
| **MFA & SSO** | Google Workspace $6/user | Okta $6/user |
| **EDR** | Defender free | CrowdStrike $8/user |
| **ZTNA** | Cloudflare One free | Zscaler $10/user |
| **SIEM** | Wazuh open-source | Sentinel pay-as-you-go |

**Typical 90-day cost for 50 users: $750-$2,000.** That's less than one ransomware payout.

## Common Hiccups & Quick Fixes

- **"Users will hate MFA!"**  
  Show them passwordless sign-in with Windows Hello. They'll ask for more.

- **"We have a 1998 server!"**  
  Use Azure AD App Proxy. Zero code changes, 15-minute setup.

- **"Zero budget!"**  
  Microsoft 365 Business Premium trial + Cloudflare tunnels = $0 for 30 days.

- **"Too complex!"**  
  Pilot with accounting first, then copy the settings to the rest.

## Mini Case Study: 25-Person E-commerce Shop

**Week 1** - AssetTiger found 43 devices and 2 forgotten AWS buckets  
**Week 2** - Rolled out Google SSO + free MFA, support tickets dropped 25 %  
**Week 4** - Moved from VPN to Cloudflare ZTNA; login times cut in half  
**Week 6** - Passed PCI-DSS self-assessment, landed a big retail client  
**Total spend: $1,089** over 90 days. ROI? They sleep at night.

## 5-Minute Quick-Start Checklist

- [ ] MFA enabled for your own admin account do this right now  
- [ ] List your top 3 sensitive data spots in a Google Doc  
- [ ] Schedule a 20-minute team call to share this roadmap  
- [ ] Book a calendar reminder for weekly log review (Fridays at 4 p.m.)

## FAQ Lightning Round

**Q: How fast will I see results?**  
A: The moment MFA is on, fake login attempts drop to zero.

**Q: Does Zero Trust slow people down?**  
A: Passwordless sign-in is faster than typing "Summer2025!" every day.

**Q: What if we're 100 % on-prem?**  
A: Install Cloudflare Tunnel or Azure AD App Proxy. Still works.

**Q: Do we need a security team?**  
A: Nope. One motivated person can run this whole plan.

## Your Next 10 Minutes

1. **Open your admin portal** and flip on MFA 3 minutes  
2. **Share this article** in your team Slack 30 seconds  
3. **Set a calendar invite** for the first segmentation test 7 minutes

That's it. You're already ahead of 80 % of companies out there.
