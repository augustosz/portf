# How to Create a Custom WordPress Plugin From Scratch in 2025 (Even If You're Not a Coder)

Let's be real at some point every site owner thinks, *"Wouldn't it be cool if WordPress just did this one extra thing?"*  
Maybe you want a tiny tweak to your checkout page. Maybe you need a custom dashboard widget for your team. Whatever it is, rolling your own plugin is way easier than juggling ten bloated add-ons that slow your site to a crawl.

So today, I'll walk you through the exact steps I used last month to spin up a lightweight plugin for a bakery site. No fluff, no jargon just the stuff that matters.

## Why roll your own plugin in 2025?

Pre-made plugins rock until they don't. Here's why a custom one often wins:

- **Exact fit** - Need to stamp every PDF invoice with your cat's paw-print logo? Done.  
- **Zero bloat** - You only ship the code you need, so your Core Web Vitals stay happy.  
- **Theme freedom** - Switch themes tomorrow and your feature still works.  
- **Easy updates** - No more crossing fingers when the "SEO Mega Pack Pro" plugin auto-updates and breaks everything.  
- **Reuse & sell** - Drop the same plugin on five client sites or list it on wordpress.org for that sweet passive income.

## Quick gear check (2-minute prep)

Before we touch code, grab these:

- **Local playground** - I use [Local](https://localwp.com) because it spins up a site faster than I make coffee.  
- **Editor** - VS Code with the *PHP Intelephense* extension. Trust me, the red squiggly lines save hours.  
- **Basic PHP** - If you can write a function and remember a semicolon, you're golden.  
- **File access** - FTP or your host's file manager works fine.

Ready? Cool. Let's write some code.

---

## Step 1 - Birth of a plugin folder

1. Open `wp-content/plugins`.  
2. Create a new folder: `my-first-plugin`.  
3. Inside, create `my-first-plugin.php`.

That's it. No ceremony, no confetti (yet).

---

## Step 2 - Tell WordPress "Hey, I exist!"

Pop open `my-first-plugin.php` and drop in this header:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: My First Plugin
 * Description: Adds a simple "Quote of the Day" widget to every post.
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * Author: You, the hero
 * License: GPL v2 or later
 */
```

Save. Refresh **Plugins** in your dashboard boom, it shows up. Don't activate yet; we'll add brains first.

---

## Step 3 - Make it *do* something fun

Let's print a random quote at the end of every post. Paste right below the header:

```php
function mfp_add_quote($content) {
    $quotes = [
        "Life is short. Eat dessert first.",
        "Stressed is desserts spelled backwards.",
        "You can't buy happiness, but you can buy cake."
    ];
    $quote = $quotes[array_rand($quotes)];
    return $content . '<blockquote><em>' . esc_html($quote) . '</em></blockquote>';
}
add_filter('the_content', 'mfp_add_quote');
```

Activate the plugin, visit any post, and **ta-da** random bakery wisdom appears.

---

## Step 4 - Level up with CSS & JS (without tears)

We want that quote to pop, so let's add some style.

Create folders:
```
my-first-plugin/
├── css/
│   └── quote.css
└── js/
    └── quote.js
```

`quote.css`:
```css
.mfp-quote {
    border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b;
    padding-left: 1rem;
    font-style: italic;
}
```

`quote.js`:
```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const quote = document.querySelector('.mfp-quote');
    if (quote) quote.style.animation = 'fadeIn 0.5s';
});
```

Enqueue them properly:

```php
function mfp_assets() {
    wp_enqueue_style('mfp-css', plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . 'css/quote.css');
    wp_enqueue_script('mfp-js', plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . 'js/quote.js', [], '1.0.0', true);
}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'mfp_assets');
```

Now your quotes look snazzy and fade in smoothly. Neat, right?

---

## Step 5 - Give users a settings page (because options rock)

Imagine the bakery owner wants to switch quotes herself. Let's build a 5-minute settings page.

```php
// 1. Create menu item
function mfp_admin_menu() {
    add_options_page(
        'Quote Settings',
        'Quote Settings',
        'manage_options',
        'mfp-settings',
        'mfp_settings_html'
    );
}
add_action('admin_menu', 'mfp_admin_menu');

// 2. The HTML form
function mfp_settings_html() { ?>
    <div class="wrap">
        <h1>Quote Settings</h1>
        <form method="post" action="options.php">
            <?php settings_fields('mfp_options'); ?>
            <label>Your custom quote:<br>
                <textarea name="mfp_custom_quote" rows="3" cols="50"><?= esc_textarea(get_option('mfp_custom_quote')); ?></textarea>
            </label>
            <?php submit_button(); ?>
        </form>
    </div>
<?php }

// 3. Register setting
function mfp_settings_init() {
    register_setting('mfp_options', 'mfp_custom_quote', 'sanitize_text_field');
}
add_action('admin_init', 'mfp_settings_init');
```

Now admins can paste their own quote. Update your earlier filter to check for this option:

```php
function mfp_add_quote($content) {
    $custom = get_option('mfp_custom_quote');
    $quote  = $custom ?: "Default: Eat more cookies!";
    return $content . '<blockquote class="mfp-quote"><em>' . esc_html($quote) . '</em></blockquote>';
}
```

## Step 6 - Test like your reputation depends on it (because it does)

Quick checklist:

- Activate plugin.  
- View a post quote appears?  
- Change theme still there?  
- Turn on `WP_DEBUG` in `wp-config.php` to catch any screamy PHP notices.  
- Run [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) to confirm no extra database hits.

---

## Common rookie traps (and how to dodge them)

- **Forgetting prefixes** - Always name functions `mfp_`, `yourbrand_`, etc. Collisions are real.  
- **Echoing raw POST data** - Sanitize everything with `sanitize_text_field()`, `esc_html()`, or nonces.  
- **Inline scripts/styles** - Use `wp_enqueue_*` so caching plugins don't hate you.  
- **Hard-coding paths** - `plugin_dir_url(__FILE__)` is your friend.

---

## Mini-FAQ (because someone will ask)

**Q: Can I sell my plugin?**  
Yep. GPL license lets you sell it, but you must share code if someone asks.

**Q: Will it break on the next WordPress update?**  
Unlikely if you stick to core hooks. I've got plugins running since 2019 that never blinked.

**Q: Do I need OOP for bigger plugins?**  
Eventually. Start procedural, refactor to classes once you hit ~500 lines. Baby steps.

---

## Your next 3 moves

1. **Ship v1.0** - Zip the folder, install on a live site, celebrate with actual cake.  
2. **Add features** - Maybe a Gutenberg block or REST endpoint next weekend?  
3. **Share it** - wordpress.org repo submission is free and the community loves fresh blood.
